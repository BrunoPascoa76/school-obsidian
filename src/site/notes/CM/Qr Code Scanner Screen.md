#View
Allows scanning for qr codes

View Models:
- [[CM/Delivery View Model\|Delivery View Model]] (used for submitting qr codes)

#TODO:
- #Discuss consider showing feedback ("correct"/"incorrect") before redirecting the user
- Handle abnormal states (null deliveries, completed deliveries)
- Make handling missing/refused permissions more "beautifully"
- #Discuss Add "scanner" overlay (the one that is like 4 corners) (this may be misleading, as the scanner can scan from anywhere in the screen, not just there)
