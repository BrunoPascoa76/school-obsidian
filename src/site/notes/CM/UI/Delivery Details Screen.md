#View
Shows details of a selected delivery (may be any delivery, current or past)

View Models: 
- [[CM/View Models/Delivery View Model\|Delivery View Model]] (fetch delivery and hold its data)

Features:
- Delivery info
- [[CM/Components/Delivery Progress Bar\|Delivery Progress Bar]]
- "Read Qr Code" (links to [[CM/UI/Qr Code Scanner Screen\|Qr Code Scanner Screen]]) (if driver)
- Display Qr Code (if customer)

#TODO:
- Hide read and display qr code components for past deliveries
- Have a separate screen for "delivery not found" (instead of just displaying an error)
