#TODO 
(these are all the todos which came to mind but don't necessarily fit into any component (yet)). Some of these are future plans while others are just suggestions

- Allow the driver to notify the customer (either the sender during the pickup or the recipient during delivery) that he's arriving. Can be as simple as a button to do a call, or more intricate, like a push notification.
- (in the far future) make simple "admin view" web app
