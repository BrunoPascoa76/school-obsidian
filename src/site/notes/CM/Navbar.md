Displays an icon for every route inside it, allowing for horizontal navigation.
While the content itself is passed from the [[CM/AppNavGraph\|AppNavGraph]], any new navigation bar items must be added manually (which could be useful for suppressing specific routes depending on user role).

Current Items:
- [[CM/Home Screen\|Home Screen]]
- [[CM/Order Screen\|Order Screen]]
- [[CM/Profile Screen\|Profile Screen]]
